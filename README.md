# Project-Euler
My solutions to Project Euler exercises. Currently this lists only Python3 solutions,
but I plan to add some solutions in other languages as well.

- `new-problem.py`: running this generates a new folder and solution template. 
Takes one command-line argument: the new problem.

All solutions should be run from the `/Project-Euler` directory. There's a small
preamble in some solutions that appends to the system path so that `Utilities` can
be imported. For example, from here you might run:

`python3 005/solution.py`
